# QuickSort

Quicksort is a divide and conquer algorithm. Quicksort first divides a large array into two

smaller sub-arrays: the low elements and the high elements. Quicksort can then recursively sort

the sub-arrays.

The steps are:

1. Pick an element, called a pivot, from the array.

2. Reorder the array so that all elements with values less than the pivot come before the

pivot, while all elements with values greater than the pivot come after it (equal values

can go either way). After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final position. This is called

the partition operation.

3. Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-array of elements with smaller values and

separately to the sub-array of elements with greater values.
