# Birthday Paradox

In probability theory, the birthday problem or birthday paradox[1] concerns the probability that, in a set of {\displaystyle n} n randomly 
chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday. By the pigeonhole principle, the probability reaches 100% when the number of 
people reaches 367 (since there are only 366 possible birthdays, including February 29). However, 99.9% probability is reached with just 70
people, and 50% probability with 23 people. 
These conclusions are based on the assumption that each day of the year (except February 29) is equally probable for a birthday.
