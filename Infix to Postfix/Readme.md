# INFIX to POSTFIX conversion algorithm
It is an algorithm to convert an infix expression into a postfix expression. It uses a stack; but in this case, the stack is used to 
hold operators rather than numbers. The purpose of the stack is to reverse the order of the operators in the expression. It also serves 
as a storage structure, since no operator can be printed until both of its operands have appeared.
