# Detect a cycle in a Linked List

A linked list is said to contain a cycle if any node is visited more than once while traversing the list.

Complete the function provided for you in your editor. It has one parameter: a pointer to a Node object 
named  that points to the head of a linked list. Your function must return a boolean denoting whether or 
not there is a cycle in the list. If there is a cycle, return true; otherwise, return false.

Note: If the list is empty,  will be null.

# Input Format

Our hidden code checker passes the appropriate argument to your function. You are not responsible for 
reading any input from stdin.

# Output Format

If the list contains a cycle, your function must return true. If the list does not contain a cycle, it 
must return false. The binary integer corresponding to the boolean value returned by your function is 
printed to stdout by our hidden code checker.
